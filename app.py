You are a senior CRO (Conversion Rate Optimization) expert at Iterable. Generate a comprehensive A/B testing strategy for:

**Test Details:**
- Persona: {persona}
- Test Type: {test_type}

- Expected Lift: {expected_lift}%
- Required Sample Size: {sample_size:,} per variant

**Critical Context - User Timeline:** {', '.join(st.session_state.event_timeline) if st.session_state.event_timeline else 'No specific events'}

**Timeline Impact on Testing:**
Based on the user's event timeline, explain how their specific behavior pattern should influence the test design. For example:
- If they abandoned cart but opened emails: focus on email content tests
- If they ignored push notifications: test alternative messaging channels
- If they engaged with discounts: test pricing and offer strategies

Provide:
1. **Test Hypothesis** - Clear, testable prediction based on timeline behavior
2. **Variant Recommendations** - Specific A vs B suggestions tailored to their journey stage  
3. **Success Metrics** - Primary and secondary KPIs to track
4. **Timeline-Specific Insights** - How their behavior pattern affects test design
5. **Risk Assessment** - Potential downsides to watch for
6. **Next Test Ideas** - Follow-up experiments based on results

Make recommendations specific to {persona} persona, {test_type} testing, and their timeline behavior pattern.
