**Welcome to the Iterable Demo Copilot.**  
This tool simulates how a Solutions Consultant at Iterable might demonstrate customer journeys and real-time campaign recommendations using AI.

### How to use this app:
1. **Select a persona** from the sidebar. Each persona represents a fictional customer scenario.
2. **Choose an event** to simulate user behavior (e.g., cart abandonment).
3. Click **'Add Event to Timeline'** to build up a sequence of events.
4. View the **journey diagram**, which highlights key touchpoints and stages.
5. Click **'Ask AI for Campaign Suggestions'** to receive campaign recommendations.
6. Click **'Ask AI for Journey Optimization'** to get strategic journey improvements.
7. The recommended nodes will be **highlighted in yellow**.

You can reset the timeline at any time, or experiment with different personas and user behaviors.
